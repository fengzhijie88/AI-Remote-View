It test if machine learning algorithms can do "remote view" using the pictures and IDs provided by remote viewing advocates.
The data can be either obtained using a simple web crawler program "Remote view data.ipynb" or download from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16U3MFa5hmrLZqUTkfCeBJPf11xLOoPig?usp=sharing. And save in a file called "data_RV".
